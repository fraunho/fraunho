- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fraunho. I worked in the field of molecular biology.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in scripting to make my life as scientist easier.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still using Old-School Perl5 for that - thus, most of my scripts are old and superseded, but do what they are supposed to do. I write and use ImageJ macros and I am willing to adapt Python programs to reach my goals. However, I am not a native in the latter language.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Working on it.

- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fraunho
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in scripting to make my scientific life easier.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m still using Perl for that - although most of my scripts are old and superseded. I write and use ImageJ macros and I am willing to adapt Python to reach my goals. However, I am not a native in the latter language.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Working on it.
